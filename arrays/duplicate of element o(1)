// this file contains the code to find the duplicate element in O(1) time complexity

/*  1 approach 
     1) sort the elements and run the counter 
     2) if(arr[i]=arr[i+1])      time complexity nlogn 

     2 approach
       1) by doing the exor but u can do this when every element from 1 to n-1 is present in the
           given array   ans=ans^arr[i] / ans=ans^i      time complexity n 
    3 approch 
       1) now we want to do this and that to in o(1)and maybe every (1 to n)element is not present in the array
           like {2,2,2,2,2,2}
           then in this approach we will mark the visited array as negative 

           class Solution {
    int ans=-1;
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int ans=-1;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++)
        {
        int index = Math.abs(nums[i]);
        if(nums [index]<0)
        {
            ans = index;
            break;
        }

        nums[index]*=-1;
    }
     return ans;

 }
}

// in this we are modifying the same array but according to leetcode we donot have to modify 

4 th approach 
  1) in this we will not modify element much we will store the element 
  according to what it's value and we can do this by using swapping 
  2) and extra element will be stored at the arr[0] index 

  ... code for this still continued 

5 th approach
  using binary search 

6 th approach 
   is time complexity is o(1) so i am thinking for hashmap still see do they actually works
