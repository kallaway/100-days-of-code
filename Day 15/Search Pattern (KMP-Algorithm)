Given two strings, one is a text string, txt and other is a pattern string, pat. The task is to print the indexes of all the occurences of pattern string in the text string. Use one-based indexing while returing the indices. 
Note: Return an empty list incase of no occurences of pattern. Driver will print -1 in this case.

There are two ways one is to do with simple brute froce  i.e. sliding window 
Other is KMP algorithm in which we only check from the point where the character which is mismatched and not the char which are equal
