https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/
The function takes two parameters - a string s and an integer numRows.
If the number of rows (numRows) is less than or equal to 1, the function returns the original string s.
A vector of strings v is created, with each element representing a row in the zigzag pattern.
The variable j is used to iterate through the rows, and t is a toggle variable indicating whether to move up or down in the zigzag pattern.
A loop iterates through each character in the input string s.
If j is 0 or equal to numRows - 1, the direction is toggled by multiplying t by -1.
The current character is added to the corresponding row in the vector v.
The value of j is updated based on the value of t.
Finally, the elements of the vector v are concatenated to form the result string, which is then returned.
Remember:

The toggle variable t is used to control the direction of movement in the zigzag pattern.
The vector v is used to store characters in their respective rows.
The loop iterates through each character of the input string, placing it in the appropriate row based on the zigzag pattern.
The result is obtained by concatenating the rows of the vector v.

public:
    string convert(string s, int numRows) {
        if(numRows<=1){
            return s;

        int t=-1;
        for(int i =0;i<s.size();i++){
            if (j == 0 || j == numRows - 1) {
                t *= -1;
                }
            v[j]+=s[i];
            if(t==1){
                j++;
