# Rules of my "100 Days Of Code Challenge"

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
June 26th, 2017

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.
2. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
3. I will push code to GitHub when I create something that makes sense.
4. I will work with skillsuccess.com where I recently started Java course.
5. I will focus mostly on Java, altough I want to learn bash scripting aside and I will count this time into it.

## Extra Points
1. If I do more than 100 hours of coding.
2. If I get any certification for finished course.
3. If I create my first Android app.

## Ideas to make this challenge more effective
1. To increase the chances of success, it's a requirement that you add a link to each of the day posts in the [log](log.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post
2. If you get upset or stuck, read this article: [Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd)
3. If you don't know why there is such an emphasis on working on the projects vs doing tutorials or online courses, read this: [How to Get a Developer Job in Less Than a Year](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645)
4. If you can't push your code to GitHub for some reason (e.g. if you're only starting to code and doing interactive exercises), provide a link to a tweet. You can think of something else as long as your challenge stays public - and you get the benefit of being committed to it and accountable for your progress.
5. Another good bonus of forking this repo -> if you haven't worked with Markdown before, it's a good way to practice.
