### My Goals

At the end of this challenge i would love to have learnt the following:

- Gsap Animation
- Object Oriented Programming in JS
- Create more front-end websites
- Learn Vue/react js
- Node Js
- Improve in refactoring code and degugging

This are the sections I am going to focus on to improve my front end skills. I hope during or by the end of the challange I will have a job in front end development or freelancing.

### Day 33

##### NPM packages and how the internet works

**Today's Progress**

#### How the web Works

The user/client types in the url of a webpage in a browser, the request is sent to the server where the website is hosted then the server sends back the response by getting the webpage content to the client. This is called client-server architecture or Resquest reponse model.

1. First when your enter the domain name it is sent back to DNS Domain Name Server where it gets the real IP address of the website.
   //https://www.google.com/maps to https://216.58.211.206:443. The protocol is http|| https, IP address is 216.58.211.206 and port number is 443 for https || 80 for http.

2. A TCP/IP socket connection is established between the server and the client. TCP is the Transmission Control Protocol and IP is the Internet Protocol, they ddefine how data travels across the web. They set the rules on how data moves across the internet.

3. The Http request is sent to the server. HTTP is Hyper Text Transmission Protocol which is a communication protocol that allows two or more systems to communicate. Http is a protocol that allows the client and server to communicate by sending and receiving messages.
   Types of HTTP methods: (GET/maps HTTP/1.1)

- GET - for requesting data
- post - for sending data
- patch - for modifying data
  The HTTP request has the :
- Start line contains: Http method, request target and http version.
- Http request header has contains Host : www.google.com, User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 and Accepted language - en-us
- Body response only when it's sending data to the server. (POST)

4. A HTTP response is sen back from the server.
   The http response contains:(HTTP/1.1 200 ok)

- Start line with http version, status code and status message.
- Response message
- response body

5. The TCP breaks the HTTP request and response into small chunks called packets before they are sent, then it assemble them into their original request and response. The IP protocol sends and routes all the packets through the internet. It makes sure the packets goes back to their respetive IP addresses.

(Amazing summary notes from Jonas course)

**Results:** I was able to understand how the internet works behind the scenes.
