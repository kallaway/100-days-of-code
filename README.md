**Today's Progress**: Accepted Challenged, added Indonesian translation to 100 days of code

**Thoughts:** Most of the time was spent on renumerating on what I want to achieve on the next 100 days. Well, I was notorious in being bad in estimations (Still is, but not by a ballpark anymore!). I realized that while I am comfortable with React, I am nowhere comfortable with plain old html js css. So I spent the rest of the day going through resources I should have read ages ago. (FreeCodeCamp + javascript.info)
