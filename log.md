# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working through Gatsby's tutorial step 6/7

**Thoughts**: The markdown plugin didn't seem to work properly even after I restarted development. The pages were partly showing up but not fully on the /sdf page like the example. I'm planning on finishing the tutorial and then working on a podcast website so I can play around with an api.
