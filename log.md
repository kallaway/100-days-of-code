**Today's Progress**: Added express server and socket.io on paint app.

**Thoughts:** Learned few things about socket.io, used express only for creating server, nothing fancy. It's now a collaborative paint app, there are few bugs that needs to fixed, there are lots of coding improvement could be done.
