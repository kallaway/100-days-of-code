# 100 Days Of Code - Log

 ### Day 0: January 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I got through 23 challenges on the Basic JavaScript section of freecodecamp.com.

**Thoughts:** Doing the math parts got me really confused.  Although, I noticed that I'm usually right with the answers but I second guess myself a lot.

 ### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I got 12 in. I completely got stopped on the Escape Sequences in Strings challenge.  I just couldn't wrap my head around it and it put me to sleep.  So, I got up and showered,  sat down and tried it again.  Still couldn't figure it out so I just googled it.  Figured out the needed code and breezed through the next ten challenges.

**Thoughts**: I hear that most coders don't have everything memorized and that Googling answers is ok... right? Well,  I've been at this coding for almost 2 years now and I feel like I'm trying all kinds of ways to approach coding.  Up until recently I never gave Google too much use but now that I'm in that rhythm I hope I can start to get the hang of it.

### Day 3: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Not much progess today... only 2 challenges.   

**Thoughts**: GEE WHIZ! Some of these challenges just make my brain bleed or something by thinking so hard.  https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/stand-in-line This challenge for some reason is not letting me through.  I think I have an idea of how to go about it but I feel like I'm missing a vital peice of info.  Maybe tomorrow I'll have better luck or maybe I can just brush up on my HTML and CSS and make some interests pages.

### Day 4: January 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started a webpage that shows off what my interests are.  I'm starting out real simple, by doing most of the HTML first, then add styling.       

**Thoughts**: I feel like I should stick to what I know and continue with that and llearn new things as I go and as I need them.  Hopefully, that's a good strategy...

### Day 5: January 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Pretty good progress today,  I added a bunch of info to the first section and went a bit crazy with the zombie ipsum.       

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling pretty good about where this is going and doing one step at a time totally helps with my sanity.  I don't feel overwhelmed on how it will look or feel but good information to keep me on track.

### Day 6: January 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added more info to some of the categories and cancelled a website I had on GoDaddy because I was not feeling wordpress.       

**Thoughts**: I'm still pretty inspired to finish this web site and I'm getting more excited about getting my original website up as a progress report site.

### Day 7&8: January 10th & 11th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I added links to key topics so I didn't have to explain more than a sentence.  Added Sections to mind and soul.  More organized with topics and how to sort them.    

**Thoughts**: Writing out ideas first in a journal totally helps with organization not having to remember details.

### Day 9: January 11th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started out with a bunch of php tutorials on how to make a blog and was on a roll... then got stuck only to find out it was outdated.  Took a break for a few hours and came back strong to keep working on my little project that I started.  I finished all three of my sections and got some example things in there so I don't forget what the pattern is.    

**Thoughts**: Working on things slowly and super small steps at a time with something like coding is amazing!  It keeps me challenged because it's review and I don't get ahead of my own knowledge and get frustrated and give up.

### Day 10 & 11: January 12th & 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've on a PHP tutorial rampage and have been soaking it all in and then applying them to my projects!  On my incrementalgradualist.com site, I got all the navigation, side bar and footer all on the include function on php!  Hopefully I'm using the right terms.  On my other project that I started, I began making a footer just for shits and gigs.  I plan on phping that so I only have to type it out once and just use the php code.    

**Thoughts**: Super confused about the dates but hey... I'm still coding everyday!  Learning languages for a key purpose makes things easier.

### Day 12: January 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Changed all of the html tags to php. Set up xampp so I could work with the php files locally.   

**Thoughts**: I'm foreseeing a road hump but I will do what I can to avoid it for face it.

### Day 14: January 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've been watching a bunch of PHP tutorials and doing the examples.  I've been practicing what I've been learning and applying it to my own project.  ALso, learning on how to do github commits and pushing and pulling without logging in? 

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I have to road maps to switch back and forth from and they are both doing the same thing with php but coming at it from different angles.

### Day 15: January 17th, 2017

### Day 16: January 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made my first branch.  I added a sidebar, a header and a little area where the posts show up.

**Thoughts**: I feel pretty good about the workflow and the amount of progress I'm having.  I don't feel overwhelmed by finishing the site before it's ready.  I feel good about applying the little things I know and when things get stuck I can go back and see what went wrong.  Googling things is getting easier again.

### Day 17 & 18: January 19th & 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Haven't done actual coding but I've been on the PHP tutorials like crazy and I've been practicing what I'm learning and applying it to places where it's needed.

**Thoughts**: I still have a healthy drive to get things done and having a few projects that needs the similar code is giving me more insight on how to make a blog a=from different angles of approach.

### Day 19: January 21st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a branch on my emptyCom project with the incomplete template from the tutorial I have been doing.  I started making it more personal.

### Day 20 & 21: January 22nd & 23rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: started consolidating my interests project because all the pages was making me confused.  so with all those pages gone i turned them all into categories on the database.  i also made the home page a little more dynamic in how it displays the data.

**Thoughts**: im not sure if im using branches correctly but i figured a way to make it work for me

### Day 26: January 28th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: WHOA! Didn;t realize i havent been logging stuff on this... but I have been working like crazy and pulling my hair out like crazy.  I added a bunch of functions that don't work at the moment and I gotta go back in thhere to see what's going on.  I also started on some pages that'll allow me to add, edit and delete categories.  Fixed up the admin nav bar to go to where it needs to go.  

**Thoughts**: i'm getting the hang of php, kinda.  i feel like i need a few more reviews on the php course and take some notes and i should be up to par with it and be able to make a blog almost from memory.

**Today's Progress**: Alright, today was a little different.  I was asked by my by a friend's landlord to make her a real estate site!  So, I started on coding the bare essentials of it.

### Day 30: February 1st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Didn't "code" for the past two days but I was doing a lot of research on how to make a CMS site go live and how to get the database on a hosting site. 

**Thoughts**: I'm getting more comfortable using PHP and scanning through code and getting a basic understanding of how the site looks and what it does.  I'm pretty excited about that because that means things are making sense and hopefully I'll be able to do some challenges on codewars.

### Day 32: February 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finally got the info I needed from a client and started coding the bare HTML and CSS stuff.

**Thoughts**: Doing this little gig has got me thinking about how to make thing easier for me when I get other clients.  I was thinking of making some bare bones templates to show future clients that want a specifc type of web site and then from there start customizing it for them.

**Link to work:** No links to this work just yet

### Day 36: February 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I have been working on the the little landing page.  I added a background picture styled some texts, added some info and a footer with some social media icons.  That was for the 4 plus days I haven't been here.  Tonight, I got started on the blank blog template.

**Thoughts**: I figured I might as well solidify php in my brain more by just redoing a blank version of what I've been doing with Edwin Diaz.  It seems to be working becasue I'm starting to remember little things here and there and how things work and how they should look.
