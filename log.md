# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 25th July 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started Basic HTML and HTML5 on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Trying to get my head around all the jargon involved in development. Trying to understand anchor, elements and adding links which takes a while to understand. Also not good to start and stop, best to remember to commit a designated time to it each day moving forward as it can get confusing picking up from where you left off. 

### Day 2: 26th July 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic HTML and HTML5

**Thoughts**: Starting to understand how it works now. There is still quite a lot of jargon in the challenges but realised it's better to try it out rather than understand every single word. Really enjoying the CSS part and how it works so seamlessly in altering the look of the HTML code.
