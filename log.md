### Day 1:  January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress as Published on Medium.com **: https://medium.com/@Gretch/100daysofcode-day-1-github-startup-4846d6367015#.r778all04

**Thoughts:** I am ironing out wrinkles in my understanding of GitHub's push/pull system, but I am slowly getting it.  Need to find someone with whom to practice.

**Link to work:**  No separate code examples today (tutorials from Git and CodeSchool).



### Day 2:  January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress as Published on Medium.com **: https://medium.com/@Gretch/100daysofcode-day-2-hanging-on-to-github-281c1dc7ba46#.rb62be6yh

**Thoughts:**  Encountering some resistance with pushing my commits.  Will consider doing the CodeSchool "Git Real" course to improve my understanding and ability to use Git on an every day basis.

**Link to work:** No separate code examples today (tutorials from Git and CodeSchool).



### Day 3:  January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress as Published on Medium.com: **  https://medium.com/@Gretch/100daysofcode-day-3-markdown-more-github-d5d489ddf46d#.o5f1zo639

**Progress:** Played around with Markdown while I was working on the Spoon-Knife demo and this coding log.

**Thoughts:** Slow day with reading of documentation and working inside GitHub.  I will reach out to someone locally who can work with me in Git so that I can practice some techniques.

**Link to work:** No separate code examples today as I worked on closing and pulling/pushing on GitHub.



### Day 4:  January 6 and 7, 2017  (Started late on Friday, January 6th and just continued through the 7th-counting only as one day, though overlapped two calendar days)

**Today's Progress as Published on Medium.com **: https://medium.com/@Gretch/100daysofcode-day-4-reach-out-to-make-progress-c4e8c3a0d9c#.ceob2bt5t

**Thoughts:** Finalized some arrangements for GitHub practice with a friend, and I'm looking forward to that happening.  I continued my FreeCodeCamp journey by finishing a few lessons, including picking up a few new ones, and I have begun the 'Basic Front End Development Projects' section of FCC.  Last year I ploughed ahead to working in JavaScript, but I've decided to complete the curriculum in sequential order hence the return to the Basic Front End Dev Projects.  The next step is to get set up in CodePen and then I should be ready to compose the tribute page project.

### Day 5:  January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress as Published on Medium.com **: https://medium.com/@Gretch/100daysofcode-day-5-give-and-git-237cef9daf6b#.d4ykgew05

**Thoughts:** Today was a great day!  I was offered the opportunity to work with someone using GitHub, and did I ever accept that offer!  After an initial explanation of the different Git tools, and some examples of the power of Git, we then discussed workflows, code management, and a little bit about the relevant team management required as teams increase in their size. We then discussed the management principles of discipline and responsbility (for individuals and for teams).   The point was repeatedly made that Git is a set of tools, and that <i>how</i> Git is utilized resides with the individual user (or project manager) to discern according to the needs of a project or an organization.  Below are the links to the two suggested Git-related tools.

Using screen-sharing in a Google hangout, in conjunction with live file-changes in Git, I began to have a better understanding of the locations where the code is living at any point in time.  Just by this one discussion today I have such a clearer view of the ability of Git to track and manage code, and similar items.  I will be exploring Git throughout this Coding Challenge, and I am really honored and humbled that this person took the time on a Sunday afternoon to share knowledge.  As a means of thanks, I will be sharing this new-found knowledge with at least two other freeCodeCampers who are working with Git, and I have begun to contemplate how I can coordinate a GitHub tutorial for the local freeCodeCamp meetup.

Here's the other lesson beyond learning Git:  "Ask and ye shall receive, seek and ye shall find, knock and the door shall be opened."  This is an ancient proverb that is still standing the test of time.  Wherein is the rub, the difficulty?  In having the courage to ask, to seek, and to knock; and, perhaps, in having to ask more than one person.  In other words, do not give up.  In other words, be vulnerable to ask, persistent to seek, and finally courageous to step through the opened door.


**Link to Suggested Git-related Tools:**  
     1.  Kdiff3:  http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/      Kdiff3 is a diff & merge program with many other utilities
     2.  TortoiseGit:  https://tortoisegit.org/       TortoiseGit is a Windows shell, basically offers overlay functionality
     
**Link to work:** No separate code examples today as I worked on commenting/reviewing/pulling/pushing on GitHub!

**From Medium:**  "Day 5 of this 100-day Coding Challenge was a great day! I learned all about Git-ing — and Giving. I am becoming more convinced that my daily lessons in programming are really just vehicles for life’s reminders, for life’s lessons.
The remainder of Day 5’s log: tl:dr…
Ostensibly the lesson I learned today regarded the use of GitHub. After Day 4’s post regarding courage to ask for help, I received a note from someone I knew via CodeNewbie (an amazing community of programmers on Twitter started by Saron Yitbarek) inquiring if I would like an additional explanation of GitHub? I answered ‘yes’ so fast, I’m surprised I did not flub my reply.
Approximately 24 hours later, we had a Google hangout up and running, and I was so happy to be talking shop with someone. Talking shop is vitally important during the days when learning something is a struggle, and this is the reason why I constantly refer people to the #CodeNewbie Twitter-chat on Wednesdays at 9 pm and to the Free Code Camp forums. Find your people, and talk shop with them. The stories you read and hear will sustain you during the hours of frustration, disappointment, even failure.
We dove right into the lesson by way of an overview of Git tools, and followed that with examples of the power of Git. We then discussed workflows, code management, and the relevant team-management tools required as teams increase in their size. From there, we moved to a discussion of the management principles of discipline and responsibility (for individuals and for teams). The point was repeatedly made that Git is a set of tools, and that how Git is utilized resides with the individual user (or project manager) to discern and decide according to the needs of a project, team, or an organization.
Two Git-related tools were suggested and I share them now: Kdiff3 and TortoiseGit.

Kdiff3 is a diff & merge program with many other utilities.
kdiff3.sourceforge.net

TortoiseGit is a Windows shell, and basically offers overlay functionality.
TortoiseGit - Windows Shell Interface to Git

TortoiseGit provides overlay icons showing the file status, a powerful context menu for Git and much more!
tortoisegit.org

We worked through different repositories in which each of us played different roles. The role one plays in a GitHub repository impacts one’s scope of authority on a collaborative project. From this one discussion, I have obtained a clearer view of what Git is, how I will be able track and manage code, and how I can better collaborate. I will continue exploring Git throughout this #100DaysofCode Challenge, and I am really honored and humbled that this person took the time on a Sunday afternoon to share this knowledge. As a means of thanks, I will be sharing this new-to-me knowledge with at least two other local freeCodeCampers who are working with Git.
Here’s the other lesson beyond learning Git: “Ask and ye shall receive, seek and ye shall find, knock and the door shall be opened.” This is an ancient proverb that is still standing the test of time. Wherein is the rub, the difficulty? In having the courage to ask, to seek, and to knock. In other words, in not giving up.
Thank you for all of your encouragement. Best wishes on your goals!

### Day 6:  January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress as Published on Medium.com **: 

**Thoughts:** Both laptop & tablet out of commission for a few more days.  I read some more Git documentation yesterday, reading quite a few blogs and updates from others participating in this challenge.  I took off a few days from programming because of the absent laptop.  Tonight I attempted to work on GitHub and FreeCodeCamp from my iPhone with limited success, and have borrowed a laptop to finish some things tonight.  Overall, a low-key, but happy week.
