# 100 Days Of Code - Log
# My Personal Commitment: I'm going to master Javascript and culminate with the freecodecamp certification on JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.


### Day 0: May 09, 2022

**Today's Progress**
Forked the 100-days-of-code repo, made a commitment on Twitter, followed a few ppl on Twitter, interacted with developers, joined the discussion on Gitter, Setup environment on Google Chrome and installed the open source application Brackets as my code editor for this challenge.

**Thoughts:**
I have been using Javascript for as long as I remember and I'd say I understand it to an extent. However, Javascript has evolved a great deal over the years from being a fully client side interpreted language to the amazing language it is today. I decided to use this challenge to master the language and create a solid foundation to learn some amazing frameworks such as Vue and React.

I'm excited to use this challenge also as a way to create a solid coding habit. I love coding but I have not yet been able to fully master a regular coding habit. I know first hand how important it is to develop solid habits to step up my game in anything I want to do. I have done this before to develop a gym habit, running habit and weight loss habit. I have been able to achieve remarkable progress healthwise. I want to expand my habit development to other areas that I want to work on such as improving my coding skills.


### Day 1: May 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**
Made a simple HTML page with some basic JS functionality and published it to Github.

**Thoughts:**
I coded on my first day of this challenge but I forgot to write to push my code to Github. It is an important lesson to get this setback so early in the game as one of the purposes for me to commit to this challenge is to develop a solid coding habit.

One of the coolest things that I learned about today was to publish my application to Github so I can make it available to the public.

The one thing I encountered was that my JS code would not run. I thought it was the environment, my configuration, the browser. It turned out that I had mispelled "scr" instead of "src" in my JS import tag. It is amazing to see that no matter how many years I have done this, that a simple mistake like this could still get me. It humbles me to see myself with a beginner's mindset again and again. To feel what it is like to start from the very beginning and build my way up.

I Twitted today that I'm going to build a nice directory on my GitHub public page for this repo so that people can navigate to my daily log one by one.

### Day 2: May 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**
I wanted to do something a bit fun so I followed the Learn JavaScript by Building 7 Games on FreeCodeCamp's YouTube channel by Ania Kubow and I followed the Rock paper Scissors game as my challenge for the day. I plan on following one of her 7 day games after each day of Bootcamp to mix it up a bit.

**Thoughts:**
I had fun doing this. I made some mods to the code to try to optimize it a bit but only using the knowledge I have learnt thus far without Googling anything.

I Twitted today my progress with a screenshot of the work and pushed my changes to GitHub.
