**Today's Progress**: Completed some FCC bootstrap challenge. Really learning a lot about bootstrap.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Bootstrap is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
