# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Built a project called "Two Thirds of Average" which I got from [ryanstutorials.net](https://ryanstutorials.net/programming-challenges) with C++. This is my first project with C++.

**Thoughts:** I am finding C++ quite interesting and I think I would love to learn more of it. I used an old editor (DevCpp) and an old version though and that slowed me down. I plan to upgrade soon so I can enjoy learning the language better.

### Day 2: October 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, inspired by the console Star Wars animation at *towel.blinkenlights.nl*, I decided to build a C++ animation called BlinkingLights. It is a simple animation that involves characters on the screen blinking and changing colour.

**Thoughts:** I found this very interesting and not as difficult as I expected.

### Day 3: October 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I created an application to extract text from images using Tesseract's C++ OCR library and OpenCV.

**Thoughts:** This project is something I've wanted to do for a long time. I'm glad I finally got to it. It was a bit easy and I did not really learn any new thing in C++, just how to use the Tesseract and OpenCV libraries. Also, having to write about it forced me to make sure I understood the code.

### Day 4: October 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I installed ReactJS, added a library for text to speech and wrote some code to call the library.

**Thoughts:** I got a bit frustrated due to technical issues with my system, but I will continue tomorrow.

**Link to code:** [Image to speech](js/ImageToSpeech/server)

### Day 5: October 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I installed NodeJS, and created the back end for the image to speech project. I learnt how to create a basic web app with Express.js, how to call commands from Node.js, how to receive an uploaded file and save it to the file system.

**Thoughts:** Today's task was quite interesting as I learnt many new things.

### Day 6: October 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I installed React.js and wrote the front end for the image to speech project. I learnt how to make requests in React using axios, how to call the SpeechSynthesis API to read out text and how to write a React application in general.

**Thoughts:** Today's task was very interesting. I learnt many new things.

### Day 7: October 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I learnt how to add simple auto-completion to a C++ application.

**Thoughts:** Although I learnt some new things like how to manipulate strings (which was my goal), I still wish to improve this auto-completion tool as it's not perfect yet.

### Day 8: October 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I started a project to search images for text with C++. I added a header file to the basicOCR project so I could reuse it. 

**Thoughts:** Had some trouble with lack of string methods which I am used to in other languages. May have to implement them myself. Also had trouble figuring out how to list files in a directory with C++.

### Day 9: October 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I completed the project on searching images for text with C++. Also hosted the project for Day 6 at https://bit.ly/2J4KFvu

**Thoughts:** Today, I fixed the issues I had yesterday, like the trouble with strings (created the functions I needed) and the trouble with the file system. Though I was delayed by external factors, I'm glad I was able to complete today's coding task. Can't say the same for the writing though :(.

### Day 10: October 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I started an application with React to add text formatting to a web page.

**Thoughts:** Today was a bit difficult. This is my second project with React and I am trying to resist the temptation to do things the normal JavaScript way rather than learning how to do them in React. Had issues with the formatting.

### Day 11: October 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I completed the text formatting project with React. It supports bold, italics and underlining.

**Thoughts:** I learnt a lot today about React. I learnt about how to properly reference elements and how to update their properties the right way, how to manipulate the DOM, how to update the state of a component and many other things. I am happy I did not have to resort to mixing JavaScript methods with React's.

### Day 12: October 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I began building a web application with Express.js to allow users run console commands in their browser. Something like SSH-ing to a remote server but in your browser.

**Thoughts:** Today's was an interesting project as it is something I have wanted to do for a while.

**Link to code:** [Web Console](js/WebConsole/server)

### Day 13: October 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I began building a neural network with Keras.

**Thoughts:** Today's was an interesting project as it is something I have wanted to do for a while.

**Link to code:** [Neural Net](py/NeuralNet/main.py)

**Link to Medium article:** [A gentle introduction to Artificial Neural Networks](https://medium.com/building-a-simple-text-correction-tool/a-gentle-introduction-to-artificial-neural-networks-7fb976b0d04?sk=ad68a351fd23781696d4b85fe9ad6958)

### Day 14: October 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I completed the neural network. I made one able to recognise handwritten digits from the MNIST database.

**Thoughts:** The neural network seems to work well with the curated data from MNIST, however, testing its accuracy on real world data is a bit difficult (due to having to prepare the data in the right format). The project was nevertheless fun to work on.

### Day 15: October 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I continued building the web application with Express.js to allow users run console commands in their browser.

**Thoughts:** Today refreshed my memory on some things I'd forgotten.

**Link to code:** [Web Console](js/WebConsole/server)

### Day 16: October 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I completed the project (at least the first release) that allow users run console commands in their browser. Also, I reviewed Ifeoluwa Onigbinde's first article (submitted to How-Tos).

**Thoughts:** I'm really proud of my progress with this project. I also hosted the project online (on a private server) to test out its performance and it was successful.

**Link to code:** [Web Console](js/WebConsole/server)

### Days 17-19: November 1, November 3, November 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: On these days, I completed coding challenges on Hackerrank and LeetCode.

**Thoughts:** I know these probably do not count for my 100DaysOfCode, but I had to do them in preparation for interviews.

### Day 20: November 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I reinvented the Counting Sort algorithm and implemented it in Python.

**Thoughts:** I've been introduced to a variant of this algorithm. It was fun today to think about the differences between my version and the variant and compare their performances.

**Link to code:** [Neural Net](py/CountingSort/main.py)

### Day 21: November 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I began working on a web application to conduct coding tests. It allows the user enter their code and then runs the code against some predefined test cases on the server, then returns the results.

**Thoughts:** Today's project was inspired by Hackerrank, Codility and the like. It's an interesting project. I am not happy that I spent 6 days off this challenge, I will try to improve my consistency.

### Day 22: November 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I continued working on the web application to conduct coding tests. I worked on the front end design today, made it look more presentable. I used plain CSS and JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** Faced some CSS issues, but resolved them.

### Day 23: November 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I finished working on the web application to conduct coding tests.

**Thoughts:** Eh.
