# 100 Days Of Code - Log
//my Log// 
### Day 1: July 21, Wednesday:

**What I Learnt Today** Getting a better understanding of using Git bash's commands, 
learned how to shallow copy and deep copy Objects in JavaScript, 
and better and manipulating arrays in JavaScript.

**Thoughts** I'm getting in deep with JavaScript now, but i feel like there is so many other Coding Languages that I have to learn or keep up with.
Git Bash is giving me a hard time, I need to Review my CSS and a bit of HTML, and JavaScript is starting to get hard.
My plan of action is to learn more Git Hub/Git Bash Thursday and Friday, and then Saturday lean in more to JavaScript for those Kew concepts in my meeting with Jamal Saturday. 
Then Sunday I'll chill and try and review/build things with HTML and CSS.

**Feeling** A bit intimidated, but I am hopefull and still ambitious when it comes to coding oppurtunities!

### Day 2: July 22, Thursday:

**What I Learnt Today** So I finally fixed my local git repo for my JavaScript class. I believe the original mistake I made was basically making clones of the my Head.
I git reset that and made sure that the connection to the remote repo was still there, so its all set now! I also set up another workspace on visual studio to practice HTML and CSS.
I was able to make multiple files and connect them, the only problem is that you i can't see how CSS is affecting my HTML. 
That will be something I have to fix.

**Thoughts** memories of the code I ran earlier in the year are flooding my mind. I am beginning to remember how to write html and css!
I am eager to try and apply some JavaScript to these pages to see what cool stuff I can do! ( I know tha will come with time though, I am in a JavaScript class for goodness sakes XD)

**Feeling** Growing in Confidences!

### Day 3&4: July 23-24, Friday and Saturday

**What I Learnt Today** I finished my Object homework!! Boy does it feel good, after I spoke with Matina I realized that I was trying to go about invoking the object within the function.
alls ya gotta do is set the value of the property to the parameters of the function that you want it to hold... its simple if you are doing it lol. 
Also learned that when you are calling certain info outside of the function so that the parameters have value is called an Argument

**Thoughts** I.Am.SO.Happy I solved the rest of the homework. It felt as though after I got over that one question I could figure out the rest. 
When I get aa chance it would be good to make up some random functions to practice, that way I know how to manipulate them better.

**Feeling**Happy that I understand the homework better.
