### Day 4: june 28 2019 (SEVENWONDERS)+(FREECODECAMP)

**Today's Progress**: Here i used bootstrap to make a page that displays all the seven wonders of the world.Concepts used here are cards,row,containers and many more from BOOTSTRAP4 .Along with that i leraned few concepts of js from freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: Again tried the potentials pf Bootstrap using few topics .

### Day 5: june 29 2019 (TENSORFLOW)+(FREECODECAMP)+(QUIKLABS)

**Today's Progress**:Today i looked few concepts of javascript. Along with that i had some hands on session at Quiklabs. Also today i started Tensorflow which is super exciting.

**Thoughts**: Started Tensorflow and looking Forward for the potential that it surely have for ml.

### Day 6: june 30 2019 (TENSORFLOW)+(FREECODECAMP)

**Today's Progress**:Today i came across fashion mnist dataset and used tesnsorflow to evaluate this model. Along with that i studied javascript in freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**:Found tensorflow super interesting with the evaluation of different models.

### Day 9: JULY 3 2019 (TENSORFLOW)+(FREECODECAMP)

**Today's Progress**:looked at taking tokenized words and using Embeddings to establish meaning from them in a mathematical way. Words were mapped to vectors in higher dimensional space.

**Thoughts**:Got the essence of nlp to a broader aspect.

### Day 10: JULY 4 2019 (TENSORFLOW)+(FREECODECAMP)

**Today's Progress**:looked at RNN and LSTMs concept with Embedding techiques.Also gone through some javascript concepts.  

**Thoughts**:Seeking the importance of RNN in particular LSTMs in action.
