# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 29, 2017 
##### Today, or rather let me say, tonight, starts my 100 days of code. I't is 01:22 a.m., I am pretty  tired, and really want to postpone for tomorrow. But there is no time like the present.
#So I begin.

##### Just ended my first hour(and 15 minutes:) of code. Made 15 excercises on codecademy: booleans. Like what is the result of "not not True or False and not True". Looks scary, but in fact just basic logic and math.
#also comitted basic tcp client, reprinted from Black Hat Python book, just to commit something, cause I can't commit excercises from codecademy. It doesn't seem to work, "Socket is not connected", but I am too tired to find a reason.


### Day 2: November 29, 2017(Yeah, the same day)
### I begin my second day of code 
###Another hour of code completed. More excercises from codecademy and reprinted UDP client from book.

### Day 3: November 30, 2017
### Day 3 begins. 
### Day 3 ended.Too tired to write something interesting.

### Day 4: November 31, 2017
instead of 1 hour of Python 2 hours of PHP excercises and 3 hoursof reading PHP code just to solve one CTF task
