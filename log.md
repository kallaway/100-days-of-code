# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started the HTML5 and CSS challenges for the Front End Development Certification

**Thoughts**: Thus far I'm not feeling too tested with these challenges. I'm sure that will change as I progress.

### Day 2: January 2, 2018, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the remaining HTML5 and CSS challenges and got through about 1/3 of Repsonsive Design With Bootstrap section.

**Thoughts**: Today I felt a slight tug not to do the challenges because I'm a little tired and Winter break with the wife and kids is starting to come to a close. In addition to that I ended up checking my work e-mail before starting so I began my hour somewhat distracted; not a good idea. Maybe tomorrow I'll try to give myself a few minutes to sort of reset my focus before starting.

### Day 3: January 3, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the remaining Responsive Design with Bootstrap challenges and got through about half of jQuery section.

**Thoughts**: Once again felt a slight resistance to starting the challenges, but I pushed through it. I didn't make the same mistake as yesterday by reading work e-mail. Nevertheless I was still somewhat distracted. The jQuery section is proving to be slightly more difficult than previous challenges mostly because I'm not that familiar with JavaScript syntax. On the upside, I do feel like I'm actually learning with these challenges so that's exciting.

### Day 4: January 4, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the remaining jQuery challenges and began work on the Build a Tribute Page project.

**Thoughts**: Didn't feel as much resistence today as I did in the previous couple of days. I've switched from Tron Legacy to Inception for music to code by; I think I like Tron a little better. :) The jQuery exercises were pretty straight forward, but I'm a little fuzzy on targeting child elements. I don't quite understand how the .target class with nth-child(n) magically finds the right element. That's just something I'll have to research a little more.

### Day 5: January 5, 2018, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Nearly completed the Tribute Page project.

**Thoughts**: Had a couple of interruption during my coding session so I spent a few addition minutes working on the tribute page project. Coming up with an idea for this project was a little difficult because I'm not that creative. I finaly came to the conclusion (right or wrong, but hopefully right) that the content of the tribute page is not what matters, it's demonstrating the ability to use what has been learned up to this point. Now I did have to google a couple of bootstrappy things, like block quotes, gradient backgrounds and rounded corners for my main "header" image. Hopefully tomorrow I'll have this baby wrapped up and be on to the next thing.

### Day 6: January 6, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Tribute Page and started the Personal Portfolio Webpage project.

**Thoughts**: Ok, so now I'm starting to feel the burn. The creative aspect of these projects is still getting in the way. Surely this will ease up as I progress and I'll over-think things a little less. Tomorrow I'm going to get out a piece of paper and sketch the portfolio page based on the user stories. I think it'll help quite a bit if I can get an idea on paper so I can actually see it. That should give me a little better aim.

### Day 7: January 7, 2018, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Focused on the Personal Portfolio Webpage project. Almost completed the first iteration of the navbar.

**Thoughts**: I sketched out on paper what I think the portfolio page should look like. That has helped quite a bit as I don't think putting ideas from brain to keyboard works well for me. On a slightly different note, it looks like I'll have quite a few placeholders for work since I don't have much to showcase. I should put the tribute page on there. Ended up spending most of the coding session struggling with the navbar. The bootstrap docs are ok, but I need it explained to me like I'm a 5 year old. :) I feel like I cheated a bit by "borrowing" some navbar code from the bootstrap site. Now that I have the portfolio site laid out, I'll dig to the navbar just to make sure I understand it.

### Day 8: January 8, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the Personal Portfolio Webpage project. The navvbar is functional including the abilitly collapse on smaller screen sizes. I've added filler text for all sections of the site and started work on smooth scrolling. Tomorrow I plan to finish the smooth scrolling stuff and start building out the first section of the site.

**Thoughts**: I have a little better handle on how the navbar works in bootstrap thanks to a couple of YouTube videos. I'm not a huge fan of the way bootstrap requires the use of the navbar class; there must be a better way! :)

### Day 9: January 9, 2018, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Ended up spending about 1.25 hours in this session. Continuing to work on the Personal Portfolio Webpage project. I did manage to complete the smooth scrolling and implement the javascript necessary to make the nav links appear active. This works when clicking a nav link or scrolling down to a give section of the page. With that out of the way, I should be able to start building out the first section of the site.

**Thoughts**: Arrggghhh! The navbar smooth scrolling stuff really killed my productivity today. I feel like I understand about %25 percent of what I've coded up thus far which is a little discouraging. Today is probably the first day I've actually felt beaten up by code. lol I'll try and get a good nights sleep tonight and be more refreshed tomorrow.

### Day 10: January 10, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Work on the portfolio page continues. The about section is nearly complete. I'd like to add a better profile pic and a nice background image tomorrow. Once that's done I'll be ready to start the "work" section.

**Thoughts**: Today was a pretty productive day. I did run into a little blocker when using the img-responsive class and padding on an image. This [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9409632/border-radius-and-padding-not-playing-nice#) helped me resolve the issue. Also discovered the [lead class](https://bootstrapdocs.com/v3.3.5/docs/css/#lead-body-copy) which is working well for the text in my about section. Definitely putting the read, search part of read, search, ask to good use.

### Day 11: January 11, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Work on the portfolio page continues. Instead of sprucing up the about section I just went ahead and started to build the work section of the site. In the work section I'm just using the bootstrap [thumbnail class](https://bootstrapdocs.com/v3.3.6/docs/components/#thumbnails-default) along with a little extra html for a parahraph and button. I tried this neat little utiltiy from [holderjs](http://holderjs.com/) to add placeholder image for one of the project pages. I just made color blocks for the rest because the sizing behavior is a little strange. For example, a 400x400px png file displays as the same size as a 400x275 placeholder from holderjs; it's odd. Switched to azure blob storage to host all my images. 


**Thoughts**: Another focused and productive day, I'd say. I find myself spending about 1.5 - 2 hours a night on this project including github and twitter updates. Feeling like I should reign that in and stick with 1 hour and just stop no matter where I am in my coding session. I'll try that tomorrow night.

### Day 12: January 12, 2018, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Work on the portfolio page continues. Today I worked on the contact page and messed around with two sites that allow you to send e-mail without any server side code. There are issues with this approach because of CodePen. I may dive into this a bit more at some point in the future. Also added glyphicons to the "view" and "submit" buttons. Tomorrow I'll work on the footer. 


**Thoughts**: Ok, so, real talk... today felt a lot like a cheat day. A LOT. I lifted waaay too much code from the bootstrap site because I couldn't remember the syntax for a component I wanted to use. I'm going to be more dilligent about not doing that because I don't want to cheat myself out of this learning experience. Perhaps I'll go through tutorials on the stuff I'm unfamiliar with as opposed to taking the easy way out. On the upside, I kept my word about stopping at 1-hour. Today I did that and it just felt right. :) Tomorrow is another day to get it right.

### Day 13: January 13, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: The footer is starting to take shape. I found some interesting examples on the [Material Design for Bootstrap site](https://mdbootstrap.com/) and ended up incorporating it into the site. Hopefully I'll have the footer complete tomorrow and then start working on the styling and fix any bugs I encounter. 


**Thoughts**: Today felt a little better than yesterday in terms of "borrowing" code from other sites. I started looking to YouTube for some instruction as well as docs on the material design site. I'll try to continue that trend and maybe do some reading or watching videos when I'm not coding.

### Day 14: January 14, 2018, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: The overall portfolio page is complete. Tomorrow I'll wrap it up with a little bit of fit and finish work. I'd like to make it so that each section fills an entire page height.


**Thoughts**: Today felt just... meh. I wasn't motivated at all so I feel like I wasn't too productive. I'll have to think about ways to stay focused for the future. Today is also one of those days where I feel like I'm not learning anything; I feel like I'm just copy and pasting. That's something I'll continue to do better at as well.

### Day 15: January 15, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I decided to call the portfolio page complete. I hope to revisit the page later and to do some refactoring and polishing up, but for now it meets the requirements of the challenge. Now I'm back on the code camp challenges; today was basic Javascript. 


**Thoughts**: Feeling very tired today and a bit rundown. The kids are battling sickness and I think I might be the next victim. I'm gonna try to get a good nights rest tonight and hopefully I'll feel better in the morning. Onward!

### Day 16: January 16, 2018, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I focused on the basic javscript challenges at free code camp. 


**Thoughts**: These basic js challenges are way more difficult for me than the previous ones around HTML and CSS. Still feeling a little bit icky today, but the code must go on! Tomorrow is another day to get after it.

### Day 17: January 17, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to focus on the basic javscript challenges at free code camp. I plan to carry on with the challenges tomorrow. 


**Thoughts**: The javascript challenges today were a bit more fun that yesterday. Learning a bit about functions and manipulating arrays with things like push() and shift() has been my favorite part thus far. Completely random thought... tomorrow I'm going to take a sort of scrum approach on the days progress. What I mean is, I'll state what I worked on that day and what I plan to work on the next day. I'll use the thoughts section to maybe outline any impediments or blockers to my progress. This way the log will lean out and be a litte more readable, I think.

### Day 18: January 18, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Another day with the basic javascript challenges at free code camp. The challenges covered things like logical operators, conditionals (i.e. if, if/else, switch, etc.), and objects. There are slightly more than a dozen javascript challenges ahead of me, so I aim to finish those tomorrow. 


**Thoughts**: The progress I made today has been encouraging. Up to this point I've managed to complete two projects and 200 challenges. While the challenges have been difficult at times, I haven't had the feeling of complete hopelessness yet. lol

### Day 19: January 19, 2018, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I put in quadruple the amount of time that I should have and still didn't complete the basic javascript challenges. There are approximately 8 more to go, so _hopefully_ I'll get it wrapped up tomorrow.


**Thoughts**: Extremely long day both coding and at work. I joined codewars and completed a javascript challenge. Going through free code camp helped to prepare me; even though it was difficult, I wasn't completely lost.

### Day 20: January 20, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today, once again, I put in way more time than I should have, but I just could not let go of the profile lookup challenge. Hoping that I'll get back on track with time-boxing these coding sessions. 


**Thoughts**: The entire session was spent thrashing around on the profile lookup challenge, but I finally got it. Only needed some small hints, but I was on the right track which feels pretty awesome. The challenges are difficult for me now, but I'm trying to remain tenacious and not give up.

### Day 21: January 21, 2018, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the basic javascript challenges and started on the object oriented and functional programming challenges. Tomorrow I plan finish that out and begin on the next set.


**Thoughts**: I started a bit earlier this time around and stuck to my 1-hour time-box. That may sound silly, but time boxing like that really helps me focused and I feel like I can get more done. Overall I'm still feeling pretty positive about this challenge; coding 1-hour a night almost feels natural now.
