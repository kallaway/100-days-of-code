# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 2, 2017


**Today's Progress**: This is my fisrtday in 100 Days of coding, today i tried to solve problems from freecodecamp, i solved four challenges there, i learned something on manipulating string and arrays, it includes .substring, .substr, .slice, .repeat, .include, .indexOf and i understand how to use Math.max.apply(arg1, array) method to find max num in array and i used map function to manipulate elements in the array

**Thoughts:** today i was really excited because this is my first day of coding challenge, i could solve the problems without any frustruation, i had to search lot in google but finally i got what i wanted. today gone well, i hope tommorow i have the same excitement.
