# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I am reading a full description of how Github works and intend to do ano hour of code when I finis, I will keep you  posted. 

**Expanding on that progress:** 
Wow! So it looks today was a lot more useful than I thought. Even though I ended up asking AI for some idea for code... since I didn´t really know what to do, I was quite entertained, realizing I didn´t know how to start a codespace from scrathc, I did but then I didn´t have the option to view my code in browser (If I do I don´t yet know how to) so I had to fork (this I knew how to do) a repo from 4geeksacademy where I´m learning *(2nd week bootcamp now)* in order to get the code from there to use the Python server. 

I made some readme on that repo. with a picture and a phrase by great Zen Master Shunriu Suzuki using markdown option that I learnt yesterday. 

**Thoughts:** 

I didn´t really know how to tackle this, I probably haven´t figured it out yet, but I´m determined to learn!

### Day 2: March 15th, 2024

**Today´s progress** Well today I am extremelly frustrated, I tried finding free excercises on the web, and couldn´t really find anything yet. 
I ended up on excercism and it looks like a really cool page, with lots of free excercises but too complicated for my level right now. 
I decided to dig into the excercises for JavaSacript which has made my life really hard on the pre-work for Full Stack Dev. Program I am in (about to finish 2nd week now). Not sure if it is the ammount of information being thrown at me or what but it was really hard solving the cipher excercise. I actually can´t claim I did. I´ve been trying various functions but didn´t really sole anything. I asked Chat GPT for help and it did, and honestly didn´t understand what it did. I really need to find easier excercises, maybe redo the ones from the prework🤔.
Anyway, not worried since in half an hour i go into 3 hours of course and we have at least an hour coding... Plus the hour I just did, which was not only coding but reading how to code... anyway...
Frustrated so far today-

**Thoughts:**
I need to get proper excercises that fit my level

### Day 3: March 16th, 2024

**Today´s progress** Well I´m seriously trying to work on my github Profile, been looking around for nice profile readme pages and found interesting videos. 
I have been struggling with a Snake thing to put on the profile, it looks awesome... I learnt what Giithub Actions are, and got totally busted with it, I cannot get it to work, spent an hour only on the snake. 

**Thoughts:**
Just need to keep preacticing, I also learnt what secrets and Tokens are.

### day 4: March 17th, 2024

**Today´s Progress** Today has been a quite day, all I did of code was the hour I´m commited to do, and It was hard to sit down. Instead of going back to trying to solve the snake thing to put on my profile that proves out of my league, though I will get it to work no doubt, cause I´m that stuborn, I did an hour of practice on very easy excercises on javaScript from the academy that we will start seeing on Wednesday I think. I did the prework over a month ago and javascript was my absolute nemesis. Now I´m going back to elemental, and except for the console.lo(Hello World) I didn´t get one excercise at first shot. I did on to number 8 which I paste now here:

> function isOdd(myNumber) {
>
> 	return !(myNumber % 2 == 0);
>
> }
> 
> console.log(isOdd(45345))

**Thoughts** I´m glad they asked us to go back to this excercises, these are the type of excercises I was looking for, very much on my level since I cannot really solve them easily at the moment.
