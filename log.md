### Day 2: September 29, 2019

**Today's Progress** I Started CSS on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts** Second day! Now it is more than just a one of hour! My streak begins. CSS is pretty cool, I am starting to get a feel for what its like to write code, CSS is more rewarding/interesting for me than HTML.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
