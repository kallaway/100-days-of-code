# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learnt the basics of CSS animation.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 2: May 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to clone repository. Also learnt some basic git commands like: 'add .', 'commit', push.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with GitHub, but, overall, considering the fact that I have a prior knowledge of some of the fundamentals, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Some features are still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality. I want to learn how to create a branch and push to the branch and also how to create pull requests and how to merge branches tomorrow.
