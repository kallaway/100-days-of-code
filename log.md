<h1 style="color: blue;">100 Days Of Code - Log</h1>

### Day 1: March 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I am reading a full description of how Github works and intend to do an hour of code when I finis, I will keep you  posted. 

**Expanding on that progress:** 
Wow! So it looks today was a lot more useful than I thought. Even though I ended up asking AI for some idea for code... since I didn´t really know what to do, I was quite entertained, realizing I didn´t know how to start a codespace from scrathc, I did but then I didn´t have the option to view my code in browser (If I do I don´t yet know how to) so I had to fork (this I knew how to do) a repo from 4geeksacademy where I´m learning *(2nd week bootcamp now)* in order to get the code from there to use the Python server. 

I made some readme on that repo. with a picture and a phrase by great Zen Master Shunriu Suzuki using markdown option that I learnt yesterday. 

**Thoughts:** 

I didn´t really know how to tackle this, I probably haven´t figured it out yet, but I´m determined to learn!

### Day 2: March 15th, 2024

**Today´s progress** Well today I am extremelly frustrated, I tried finding free excercises on the web, and couldn´t really find anything yet. 
I ended up on excercism and it looks like a really cool page, with lots of free excercises but too complicated for my level right now. 
I decided to dig into the excercises for JavaSacript which has made my life really hard on the pre-work for Full Stack Dev. Program I am in (about to finish 2nd week now). Not sure if it is the ammount of information being thrown at me or what but it was really hard solving the cipher excercise. I actually can´t claim I did. I´ve been trying various functions but didn´t really sole anything. I asked Chat GPT for help and it did, and honestly didn´t understand what it did. I really need to find easier excercises, maybe redo the ones from the prework🤔.
Anyway, not worried since in half an hour i go into 3 hours of course and we have at least an hour coding... Plus the hour I just did, which was not only coding but reading how to code... anyway...
Frustrated so far today-

**Thoughts:**
I need to get proper excercises that fit my level

### Day 3: March 16th, 2024

**Today´s progress** Well I´m seriously trying to work on my github Profile, been looking around for nice profile readme pages and found interesting videos. 
I have been struggling with a Snake thing to put on the profile, it looks awesome... I learnt what Giithub Actions are, and got totally busted with it, I cannot get it to work, spent an hour only on the snake. 

**Thoughts:**
Just need to keep preacticing, I also learnt what secrets and Tokens are.

### day 4: March 17th, 2024

**Today´s Progress** Today has been a quite day, all I did of code was the hour I´m commited to do, and It was hard to sit down. Instead of going back to trying to solve the snake thing to put on my profile that proves out of my league, though I will get it to work no doubt, cause I´m that stuborn, I did an hour of practice on very easy excercises on javaScript from the academy that we will start seeing on Wednesday I think. I did the prework over a month ago and javascript was my absolute nemesis. Now I´m going back to elemental, and except for the console.lo(Hello World) I didn´t get one excercise at first shot. I did on to number 8 which I paste now here:

> function isOdd(myNumber) {
>
> 	return !(myNumber % 2 == 0);
>
> }
> 
> console.log(isOdd(45345))

**Thoughts** I´m glad they asked us to go back to this excercises, these are the type of excercises I was looking for, very much on my level since I cannot really solve them easily at the moment. 

### day 5: March 18th, 2024

**Today´s Progress** Did my hour today and I feel being on track. I am following my teacher´s advice on **@4geeksacademy** and I am redoing teh practice on JavaScript from the prework as I said yesterday I feel a lot better than yesterday. Just went through all the excercises from yesterday and I am undertanding a lot better than during the prework the calling of functions. 

> function shortIntroduction(name, profession, age) {
>
>  return "Hello! my name is " + name + ", my profession is " + profession + ". I am " + age + " years old.";
}
>
> console.log(shortIntroduction("Matias", "Full Stack Apprentice", "44"))

**Thoughts** I am telling myself I will love Javascript! some good old NLP.
BTW I am already due my hour of code and still looking to 3 hours class and coding. 

### day 6: March 19th, 2024

**Today´s Progress** Today was the first time I actually finished a `javascript` excercise without having to consult. I was able to think, and come up with the solution. 
Of course there where the typical initial things on learnpack, but I am thrilled I actually could do the whole thing on my own. 

> let guests = prompt('How many people are coming to your wedding?');
>
> function getPrice(guests) {
> 
>    let cost = 0;
> 
>   if (guests <= 50) {
>
> return cost = 4000
> 
>   } 
>   else if (guests <= 100) {
> 
> return cost = 10000
>  }
>  else if (guests <= 200) {
> 
> return cost = 1500
>  }
> else {
>  return cost = 20000
>  }
> return cost;
> }
>
> let price = getPrice(guests);
> console.log('Your wedding will cost ' + price + ' dollars');

**Thoughts** I know this doesn´t sound much like an achievement for those who are into coding but for me it´s a big first step

### day 7: March 20th, 2024

**Today´s Progress:** I´m thrilled that I got this one to work. I didn´t really understand it very well in the prework but today as I practiced the rest I found out I was really getting the idea. I had to pip a little to get the kickstart but then all worked fine:

#### The fizzbuzz problem in javasript

> function fizzBuzz() {  
>
>	for (let i = 1; i < 101; i++) {
> 
>	if (i % 15 == 0) console.log("FizzBuzz"); 
>
>	else if (i % 5 == 0) console.log("Buzz");
> 
>	else if (i % 3 ==0) console.log("Fizz");
> 
>	else console.log(i);
> 
>	}
> 
> }
>
> fizzBuzz();

**Thoughts:** Nothing much, just keep practicing. 

### day 8: March 21st, 2024

**Today´s Progress:** Today I did a lot of practice on JS and I´m super happy that we are starting to use it in a good fashion. I´m buidling a data archive for workers using de .map to itereate over teh data base. not yet finished but I will post the code tomorrow. Did more than an hour on this today. 

**Thoughts** happy!

### day 9: March 22nd, 2024

**Today´s Progress:** Today I´ve spent quite some time going over `arrays` in javaScript with some cool excercises from Leanrpack at #4geeksacademy.
In addition to that I kept working on the map function on using a list o objects to create a list. 

**Thoughts** As I was going through the array´s excercises I realize I know understand almost everything that´s happening inside the loop and how it is being called. 

### day 10: March 23rd, 2024

**Today´s Progress:** I skippede this day. Had to spend time with my family doing things. So Day 11th, I´m doing a lot more.

### day 11: March 24th, 2024

**Today´s Progress:** I am already two hours into reading material and making excercies. Now I´m redoing the functions excercise from the prework for full stack dev. 

**Thoughts** It was good having a break yesterday and today having a lot of time to work on code

### day 12: March 25th, 2024

**Today´s Progress:** What a day of code! Today I managed to use the function `.map` to properly design a workers list with some interesting skils inside an `array` and display it both on a `<li>`and on `bootstrap cards`.
It was super challenging to get the cards to lie in a row 3 per row, cause I wasn´t getting them inside the right `container` in the beggining, but "with a little help from my friends" at @4geeks cohort 65 🤘🏼 (you rock guys) exchanging ideas I got to do it.

**Thoughts** I am super happy, cause I can see I am making a lot of progress, I read my log 10 days ago and now and I am amazed how much I came through in 10 days.

### day 13: March 26th, 2024

**Today´s Progress:** Spent some time today diggin more into for loops and arrays for an excercise we have to do for the bootcamp, so I managed to get to make a domain generator using nested `for``loops`.
It felt right to also put an image background and it reminded me of the classic and `most excellent movie` *Bill % Ted´s bogus journey* where they meet the devil who says: *"choose your destiny"* so I had to style the image into the background of the body using `<style>`

**Thoughts** I feel I´m making progress! 🦾

### day 14: March 27th, 2024

**Today´s Progress:** I spent more than an hour today in the domain generator in order to include more domains `.es, .edu, .org, etc` ⌨️ and finally inserted an `if`to make a `domain-hack`in case there is a "puedes" at the end, and turn it into **pued.es** (.es is the predominant domain for **Spain**).
It took me a while but got it to work!

**Thoughts** I am feeling more confortable, both solving things on my own as well as being more effective in asking google or Chat GPT when I get stuck.
