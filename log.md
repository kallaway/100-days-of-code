# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 26 : April 10, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**:Today I finish a new algorithm, the Sorted Union that takes arrays from an object arguments in a function and sort the values in it. Before this algorithm I solved new ones using differents JavaScript methods.

**Thoughts** I'm come backing again to the challenge, I lost some days and I'm sure about what I did, but I'll keep going day by day. Futhermore, I'm so close to finish my Front End Curriculum.

### Day 25 : April 01, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I solved the DNA Pairing Algorithm spliting the string in an array and using a switch else case to check the DNA letter and match the right combination or pair as a new array to be returned.

**Thoughts** That time it was easy and fast the solution I made it.

### Day 24 : March 29, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: In this day, I solved the Pig Latin algorithm using a function to check if a consonant is a vowel or not, and return true of false. Then, I implemented a for loop to iterate through the string withou split it in an separate array. I created some conditions to check each letter and apply methods. Also, I came back to the De Bus application, so I learn how to change the APK icon in the app with React Native.

**Thoughts** Sometimes many ideas come from, so it's nice to write the ideas on paper and apply it, instead go directly to code.

### Day 23 : March 27, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Solving a new algorithm from freeCodeCamp, Pig Latin. I'm trying to solve that with string and array methods to split a word, see if it is a consonant or a vowel and apply the neessary changes.

**Thoughts** I'm trying to be present, think more about the problem, how it works, how I can solve that, etc.

### Day 22 : March 26, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I solved the search-and-replace algorithm so fast in less minutes with less lines of code. Awesome! It was necessary just two methods to solve it. Now I'm working in the next challenge Pig Latin, but it requires more ideas, I think.

**Thoughts** Refresh your mind, relax and come back to it.

### Day 21 : March 26, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today for an hour I spent coding with React Native, understand components, how React is called and create components with React, React Native to be render in the mobile device. And I had some problems to config and run.

**Thoughts**

### Day 18 : March 20, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finally I solved the Wherefore Art Thou algorithm using the filter method that return if each value or object in this case is true or false to the applyed condition. So, it works very well. Now I need to solve the Search Replace algorithm using specific methods. I getted to replace the match strings value, but it is necessary replace correctly if the letter is higher or lower case.

**Thoughts** Reach-Search-Ask are the secrets to go foward.

### Day 16 : March 16, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today, I was again trying to solve the Wherefore Art Thou algorithm, but I get struggle because I'm making a mistake in my logical to compare the key-value from the objects. Then, I studied React.js, and learn about Router with components, how to make it.

**Thoughts** It is necessary more practice with React.js to to understand the functional programming.

### Day 15 : March 15, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I'm making some mistake in my logical to see if there is the key-value in the object collection to add to a new array. What I'm doing it is right, however, each time add the same key-value if the second or the third one exist. What I need to do first, tough, it's compare the object lenghts with the 'Object.keys(object)' and verify, then add it.

**Thoughts** If I struggle, I'll ask for help on FreeCodeCamp javascript help chat.

### Day 14 : March 14, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: This Wherefore Art Thou algorithm is taking a little of time, I solved part of the problems, but the other is not working very well. I'm using methods to improve and fix the logical problems.

**Thoughts** Try different thoughts and solutions, it works!

### Day 13 : March 13, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Solving the algorithms on freecodecamp challenges yet, and I finished the Roman Numeral Converter. It was necessary more lines of code to complete this challenge.

**Thoughts** I'm fine with my solution, but I think can be better.

### Day 12 : March 12, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Solving the algorithms on freecodecamp challenges. It is necessary remember some stuffs and learn anothers.

**Thoughts** Some problems it is necessary think more, take a time, and keep with the solutions.

### Day 11 : March 06, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: React.js

**Thoughts** Keep going to learn more about React.js and improve my skills.

### Day 10 : March 06, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Keep going in my Intermediate algorithms. This time I added more key-values on romanSymbols objetcs to iterate through the conditions and return it to the array. Now I need test it and concat.

**Thoughts** I read-search this time. The feeling is like jump some rules,but I think is normal and it is ok!

### Day 9 : March 05, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I'm solving the Roman Numeral Converter algorithm using functional programming, so in this time I created more one functional to fill the numbers in an array with their respective decimal value. This is important to take each value to convert.

**Thoughts** Sometimes take a break in a problem you are trying to solve and then come back and try it again. Your ideas will flow up.

### Day 8 : March 02, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I'm working in a second algorithm to convert numbers in roman numbers. It's a little complicated in this moment to understand a better way to convert. What I'm doing is to create functions using functional programming to convert numbers in string(s) and split this string in caracters, then create a new array with for each number with its decimal place and return it.

### Day 7 : February 28, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Two algorithms solved in one day, in less than 90 minutes. First I solved the 'Sum All Numbers in a Range' getting the max and min value in an array, then I made a while loop to sum in each iteration the values. Second algorithm was 'Diff Two Arrays' and I solved using some If Else conditions to see the largest array and find for values in each array, 'indexOf' function it was a good deal to loop through the arrays.

### Day 6 : February 27, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I get started my Intermediate Algorithm Scripting on freeCodeCamp working to sum all numbers in a range by arrays as arguments. I get stuck in some parts because I was thinking about some solutions to solve it, but I didn't get success. I read and implemented some javascript functions like 'Math.max()' and 'Math.min()' to get the minimum and maximum values.

**Thoughts** Withou success at this day I kept going forward!

### Day 5 : February 26, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the Twitch Web App giving some style but I'm not satisfied yet, so before I finish my Front End Curriculum I'll improve that.

**Thoughts** Design requires experience and creativity, so it is necessary to read more, learn with other different projects, get new ideas and apply it.

### Day 4 : February 24, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Learning more from React.js fundamentals, how to create components, to implement it and create child components with their parents. I learned how to change and execute the programm in production and not, ran webpack to bundle everything in one file to be transformed by Babel.

**Thoughts** I was motivated but I need to handle the time and set especific time.

### Day 3: February 23, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the functional part of my Twitch App. It required to think more about to get the data for each case like all streamers, only online and offline. The first two cases it was easy to complete, but the offline case I needed to think more, and I solved get a json value, replacing part of a string for a string I wanted and send it as an URL with getJSON function. It WORKED! Now, I need to improve and UX and UI giving style, testing in different devices with Google Developer Tools, etc.
Also, I'm studying and learning React.js with a course of React.js Fundamentals. It's nice, I'm liking, it's JavaScript, but a little bit different with a different style, so sometimes it is confusing to understand functions, objects or methods. And of course, as a new tool, the team behind has created new concepts like JSX that is a function to render HTML inside JavaScript.

**Thoughts** Sometimes it is necessary remember old stuffs, and to be creative with solutions. I did it! I thought don't finish the functional part today.

### Day 2: February 22, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through more one time in my Twitch App Project on FreeCodeCamp. This time I settled a switch case for all, online and offline streamers case. For each case I get the JSON using getJSON function iterating with a for loop. Also, each case is activated when the user choose a nav-tab, so it is necessary change the nav using jQuery.

**Thoughts** Read and Search and implement it. Take a time, think more, make mistakes but save your code before :)

### Day 1: February 21, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through my Twitch App Project on FreeCodeCamp. I get stuck applying the same solution for a different problem. So, I tried a different solution and it is working. Next, I'll use jQuery to activatethe nav-tabs and filter the streamers channels.

**Thoughts** Try different solutions for problems you think that same solution it'll works!

### Day 0: February 20, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Condition If Else implemented in my Twitch App to verify if JSON is null or not but it's not working. Maybe the forEach function or $getJSON can be asyn while it interating the array.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with getJSON function to the get the data at the same time. I need to see how to fix it to make my app works!
