# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Basic HTML and HTML5 course on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** This was monotonus and boring, I realize now I can just finish the 5 final projects to get the certification and move on to the JavaScript curriculum.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
