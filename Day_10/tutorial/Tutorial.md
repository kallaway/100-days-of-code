# Day 10 - Taking User Input in python
In python, we can take user input directly by using input() function.This input function gives a return value as string/character hence we have to pass that into a variable
## Syntax:
```python
variable=input()
```
But input function returns the value as string. Hence we have to typecast them whenever required to another datatype.
## Example:
```python
variable=int(input())
variable=float(input())
```

We can also display a text using input function. This will make input() function take user input and display a message as well
## Example:
```python
a=input("Enter the name: ")
print(a)
```
## Output:
```
Enter the name: Harry
Harry
```
