# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Derek]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [April 18, 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
Today's Progress**: Learned how to make a simple informational console application informing the user about some characteristics of Python. 

Thoughts: Digging a little deeper into Python helps me to understand why it is the world's favored language. Today I learned about the {} .format() method for injecting variables into a string, several ways to use the input() function, using ctrl+e to comment out sections in Geany, and using an if statement with the colon which is a little different than C but still very intuitive. I really think that Python could become my language of choice if I keep diving in.

### R1D2
Today's Progress**: Learned how to use .append() function, import directive, and negative index numbers in a list

Thoughts: I am enjoying Python so far. Although small pieces of code seem to take a long time because I need to look things up, once I do it once or twice it is very intuitive.

### R1D3
Today's Progress**: I made my first successful while loop in Python using the Fibonacci sequence and based on user input. I also learned my way aroung Github a little better. 

Thoughts**: Even though for loops are in most cases superior to while loops, the programs I have written for C++ and C# always used for loops so I haven't really used while loops much at all. As a beginner in Python I figured I would start learning the right way and use one to do a Fibonacci sequence, which I found a bit tricky at first. I learned the value of stepping away from the machine for a few minutes and coming back. I am not happy with the video presentation on Twitter, as the tweet was in two pieces, and my video and audio quality are still pretty bad. I am, however, happy with my progress in Python for the day.

### R1D4
Today's Progress**: Today I used a lot of new methods, including pop(), insert(), str(), max(), min(), stdev(), variance(), and mean(). I learned that I need to import the statistics module if I want to use certain methods. I created random numbers within a loop (my first Python for loop). I first used ctrl+y to undo a previous edit. Tomorrow I want to study more about definite vs. indefinite iterations. 

Thoughts: I learned a lot today but I felt that it came quicker than before. I feel my journey is well underway now. I had some problems first importing the statistics module; it didn't seem as if I had that module at first but upon the second try, the auto-complete/intellisense kicked in and I knew at that moment that it was there. Everything worked from that point in. This is the second day that I ran into some roadblocks trying to do what I wanted to do. I realize that harder times are ahead but I also know that is the only way to really learn something.

### R1D5
Today's Progress**: Used pow() to raise a number to a power and bin() to convert an output variable to binary code. I also used another while loop today, creating an 'infinite loop' so that a user may input data as many times as needed to test the algorithm. 

Thoughts: Today, on Day 5, I finally felt like I can turn on the editor and start to write a simple program that makes some sense without having to look everything up. It is helping me to write things out on paper using a diagram or pseudocode before I just start typing. I think that is the key to writing efficient code. I really do, however, feel that it takes too long to crank out certain pieces of simple code, such as today's while loop. While I can type it quickly, sometimes putting a math problem into Python language proves to be something I have to look up. I am hoping to speed up soon. I still am producing crude videos on twitter but am going to try using a new app tomorrow to record video internally, while making multiple apps visible.

### R1D6
Today's Progress**: I learned about the sort() and sort(reverse=True) method, what the error message EOF means, ways to sanitize user input, and combining 'or' operators (in fact, I hadn't used an or operator in Python before-I was trying to type ||). I learned about the elif() statement but I didn't actually use it for my program, as I need to drill down deeper into the logic. I made ASCII art in the console, and even that was a bit of a challenge because I learned that I need to cut off the quotation marks right after the last character of input. All-in-all, I worked all day learning Python. Luckily, I am a teacher and am on summer holiday with the school system I work for, so I have time. 

Thoughts: Today was the most challenging so far. I really wanted to get the Monty Hall problem complete, but also wanted to sanitize user input and make a little bit of ASCII art at the top illustrating each of the three doors. The real challenge came at the end. After repeated testing, I knew that my probabilities were not coming out right. Continued manipulation of the if-else statements at the end finally gave me statistically accurate results. I also dealt with some hardware issues when I had a mouse freeze up. I found a good video editor but then I was having difficulty converting the .AVI file to .MOV or .MP4. Then I was able to convert but not able to upload to twitter. I finally got that problem solved as well but the public video will only play on an iPhone but not Windows10. I will add that issue to my to-do list for catch-up stuff. I learned more today than any other day and the reason I got caught up so many times was because I am pushing myself hard. I refuse to copy any other code, but insist on figuring out problems on my own.

### R1D7

Today's Progress**: Used append() to put user data into a list, len() to create a variable for the length of that string, and ' ,'.join() to remove the quotes from the string when using the data in a readable format (as output). 

Thoughts: I am getting in the flow. Things are taking less time, and I am starting to visualize how to create basic structures in Python, i.e. get it to do what I want it to do. First I wanted to put user inputs from a SWOT Analysis into a dictionary, but I decided that a list would make more sense, since I had no need for key-value pairs. However, I do understand that a much larger program could use a dictionary to decipher the inputs. I will consider this in the future. My streams are looking better when I record tham.

## R1D8

Today's Progress**: Today I configured some settings in IDLE and learned how to make a dictionary, as well as a dictionary within a dictionary. I used these tools to make another console app, this one explaining the planets in the solar system. 

Thoughts: The string at the bottom of the program (which is really the main part of the program) took some time. Getting the output to display only the values took a while to figure out. I did get it to work, but I am not sure if it was the most efficient way. I want to start testing runtime using different methods so that I will be ready when I get outside the console apps and start writing my first GUI in Python.

### R1D9
Today's Progress**: Today I learned a little bit about ways to sort through lists. I learned about the Bubble Sort, the Merge Sort, the Quick Sort, the Selection Sort, and the Heap Sort. I learned how to activate the sleep function with seconds as a parameter to slow a program down so that a user may read or examine contents of a console application. I wrote my first function in Python, using the def command. I learned about the range function. While I knew the range could normally assign the amount of iterations in a for loop with two parameters (e.g. range(1,20); start at 1 and stop at 16) what I did not know was that the range function can be defined with one parameter (e.g. range(16)) meaning count from 0 to 16 (stop at 16), and can be defined with three parameters (e.g. range(19,0,-1)), meaning, in this case, that the program is to count down -1(step)) from 19(start) to 0(stop). 

Thoughts**: I originally planned to do all five sorts in one program, but since these methods are new to me in the Python environment, I soon discovered that while it would be possible, I would be cramming too much data into one day. While the Bubble Sort might not be the most useful tool, it seems to be taught as the gateway to more useful (and complex) methods of sorting. I had some difficulty figuring out the logic when writing the code for the bubble sort, and I do plan to give it further study tonight and tomorrow because the Merge sort is more complex. For the five programs I would like to add on a sort of function that returns runtime and memory usage for each process (and other processes as well). As I approach Day 10, I plan to work on writing better code for familiar topics, while increasing related skills such as commenting code, appropriately naming variables, using hardware and software efficiently, knowing Windows hot keys to speed up my work, testing and speaking better during my presentations, and testing I/O across various apps, browsers, and operating systems.

### R1D10
Today I learned about the Merge Sort. The Merge Sort is very efficient and is in common usage. It is a bit complex to code at my level and seems to use a lot of memory for large data sets. I only used 10 numbers in this set. It is a quick algorithm, meaning it runs quickly through the processor.  

Thoughts**: I learned some basics today, including the "//" operator in Python 3, which, like the "/" operator in Python 2, simply returns an integer value, even if the expression has a remainder. I learned how to find a line in IDLE when there is an error by pressing Alt+G. I learned different ways to split the list using split() and using [:x] to find the x from the right of the set.

### R1D11
Today I streamlined a lot of my existing skills, streamlining a user-input for loop to create random variables, this time without naming each variable after an if statement. I learned the theory behind the quicksort, but didn't complete it yet. I plan to begin work on it again tomorrow. I learned better ways to use the 'i' counting variable within a for loop or while loop for indexing variables. All-in-all, I learned a lot.   

Thoughts**: I worked late because I wanted to finish the Quick Sort. Tonight when I sleep on it I think I will have new ideas in my head tomorrow. I did, however, learn exactly how it worked, so while I feel that I can explain it fairly thoroughly, putting it into code proved to be a big challenge. That is okay, because I am at my best when I am over my head in new information. I still have four more days of holiday until I return to full-time work so I am obviously pushing myself to learn all I can before I have a shortage of time.

### R1D12
Today I learned some good coding habits, including using the print() statement a lot, then commenting it out when I figure out if the snippet of code is working. I learned about the return statement, in that it can be used independently to end the execution of a method, or to return a value. I learned about index values, and collisions. In fact, I believe that is my problem right now with this program. I also learned how to separate a list (e.g. by < or >). This will prove a valuable skill as I continue to learn Python.    

Thoughts**: I worked all day and night trying to figure out how to get the code for this quick sort to work on my own. I don't just want to copy and paste large pieces of code-I want to spend the time learning it, making it, breaking it, and seeing my mistakes so that I can become a better programmer. While I probably learned more today than any other day, I am not happy with my progress because I still do not have a workable program. I will continue again tomorrow!

##R1D13

Today's Progress**: I learned a valuable script for creating random numbers with x = random.sample(range(a,b),y). I learned the meaning of partitioning, which, in this context, means to split a list into parts based on some criteria, such as a pivot value. I learned a drawback when coding recursive algorithms, such as the Quick Sort, which is that if there are indexing conflicts it can cause a stack overflow. I polished my skills in boolean user-defined preferences by asking the user if he/she would like to assign random variables or use a predefined set. So, my array was already defined, but if the user wants, he/she could change it. I also learned a convenient way to create multiple arrays in one line, with the script a,b,c = [][][]. 

Thoughts**: I feel good that I finally finished the Quick Sort. I learned that there are many different ways to do it, and that the way I was attempting in D11 and D12 was more difficult. I made a ton of mistakes today too though. Soon I want to research Big O notation to really understand how and why each of these sort methods are better at different times. I am sure that many complex algorithms examine the dataset first then use whichever set is most efficient. I would like to perhaps build a project on this in the future.

#R1D14

Today's Progress**: I used some new testing methods today, considering the algorithm I was working on involved iterations. I learned the theory of it, but want to explore the various ways that (it seems) one can compute it. It appears that the algorithm can be computed by selecting max values or min values, and can also involve splitting the data into two arrays, or simple popping and appending the existing array.  

Thoughts**: I work on this in the morning and at night. I had a large errand to run across town and didn't get as much progress as I would have liked. I do feel that things are coming to me more quickly now. Tomorrow I plan to learn the Heap Sort, which I think is very complex. Tomorrow is the day that I go to teaching (we have been on summer holiday in my school system) so I am going to do my best to finish the Heap Sort with any spare time that I have.

### R1D15 
Today's Progress**: Today I worked on a Heap Sort. It is a fairly efficient sorting algorithm. Memory usage when using it is low, the time to code it is minimal, and it is consistently fast, though at times not as fast as the Quick Sort. Actually, while I was learning about the Heap Sort, I learned a lot about indexing and visualizing a list as a heap, or binary tree. I also learned about the math.log2() function, which is very helpful when dealing with decision science. I do not know whether or not I will incorporate this function into the final version of my Heap Sort algorithm. I also learned more about recursion, why it is important, and why calling functions within functions illustrates it. 

Thoughts: Learning about something first before attempting to code it has major advantages. Today I learned to visualize nodes in an array form. While simplistic, it is a new way to look at things for me. As a side note, understanding recursion will make me a better investor, since I do incorporate algorithmic trading into my strategies. Being able to think about things in a less linear fashion will certainly make me less dependent on other's formulas and more able to develop my own indicators on more than just simple chart patterns. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/15_HeapSort.py]

R1D16

Today's Progress**: Today I learned the uses of the floor() function (to remove the decimal portion of a number and convert it to the lower integer. It has its uses in the binomial tree when we are trying to index the parent node of the child, where the left side (2i) and the right side (2i+1) have the same parent. I also improved on translating pseudocode or code from other languages like C++ or C# into operable Python structures. I encountered the recursion error and found a way supposedly to cure it using the sys module but I didn't find it much value for my actual need so I deleted it-my error was still there and there wasn't much this fix would improve. I know it's there when or if I need it again but I didn't see a need to explore it any further. I learned the famous heapify() method and I wonder why that is not in the standard Python library since it seems to common and standard for this sorting method. 

Thoughts: As I stated on twitter several days ago, one of the things I have noticed so far about Python is that some activities that appear difficult are very simple to accomplish but some things seem simple but in reality are very complex. As I learn the syntax, I continue to struggle with indexing errors and adjusting the entire program so that they are corrected accordingly. I find some things to be unnecessarily complicated but I think that I am still trying to use C-like syntax for many tasks. I think once I start to experiment with the frameworks and libraries I will become more used to Python.

R1D17

Today's Progress**: Today I simply made a console application to compute binary and hexadecimal numbers. I used the standard python functions of bin() and hex(), then wrote custom functions to computer the numbers as we would manually on paper. I also practiced doing min() and max() functions on a set of numbers

Thoughts: Today I had to teach in two different parts of town and in the morning had to plan for the lessons for about two hours. I got home pretty late. So I wanted to do one of the lighter programs that I had planned. Using bin() and hex() turned out to be simpler than I thought so I decided to show the division by base method to show each step when manually representing numbers in base 2 and base 16 formats formats. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/17_BinaryandHex.py]

R1D18

Today's Progress**: today I started on writing my own binary search function after practicing some other coding that I thought might be useful towards today's work but turned out not to be. I did learn about simplifying code using the list comprehensions, the sum() function to add up all elements of a string, the list() function to wrap a range into string format, and about avoiding an obscure error dealing with a name of one of my other files in my working directory (numbers.py). So I learned a lot. 

Thoughts: I didn't finish what I wanted to however. I really felt like I was prepared to tackle the binary search and the work started off well. Soon I ran into conflicts when I attempted to make my custom function recursive. I reworked it, trying to make it iterative, then I realized something else, that was fairly obvious. This should not simply be searching for a number that you know is there-there needs to be a boolean switch to determine if the number is actually in the list. All-in-all, that gives me two problems to work on tomorrow. As is usually the case, on the day that I feel like I got little done, I actually learned a lot. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/18_BinarySearch.py]

R1D19

Today's Progress**: Today I redid most of my binary search program and got it working. I learned a lesson about naming variables exactly. Somehow, variables that are not named exactly just don't seem to fall in place, even though you think you know what they are meant to represent. I learned about returning a non-familiar object when a failure or error is encountered, such as -1 for a method that should under normal circumstances, return a zero or positive integer. I learned about the NoneType error, and that when I see it, it must mean that what I am looking for is not being returned correctly. 

Thoughts: I didn't think my binary search idea would take too long, with some idea of iterative and recursive sequencing in my mind now on the 19th day. However, refusing to just copy and paste, I worked through it for hours figuring out why each thing was the way it was and did what it did. The end result was a working binary search method. While it uses a simple array of one-off numbers (1-10 for indexes of 0-9), it could easily be scaled up. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/19_BinarySearchPart2.py]

R1D20

Today's Progress**: Today I learned to work with a list within a list, learned all about recursive functions in Python, including base case and recursive case using if/else and calling global variables within a function, dealing with dictionaries vs. lists, and even a little about business planning in Python (at a simplified and theoretical level).

Thoughts: I started off wanting to learn more about recursive functions. I was sitting at a coffee shop looking over some simple examples, and thought about making a simplified profit example based on total purchases in a typical evening. Soon I was putting in some sales numbers for receipts, with each array within the dictionary being equal to one hour's sales. Since C# is my first language, it came natural to write an iterative function and I figured that I would leave that in, just to do the calculation both ways. I learned that in python, a dictionary value can only be listed once within an array, so what I originally planned to do as a dictionary turned into a list. Then I spent the remainder of the afternoon before my teaching appointment writing out basics for the recursive part of the program. As usual, I hit a few snags but I am up late again, finishing up this program. I will be tired tomorrow, but it is worth it, because today I really starting feeling natural at writing functions and even wrote my first recursive function without having to get any help from examples on the internet. I am pretty proud of that. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/20_ClosingTime.py]

R1D21

Today's Progress**: I learned today how to better utilize multiple operations and functions within a method. I also learned to import and execute sound files to the application (.wav), using the correct format and file structure. This console application actually creates tap codes from input. In the future, I will fix it to do sentences. 

Thoughts: It is pretty obvious to me that this could be achieved with far fewer lines of code using a two-dimensional array. However, today, as well as yesterday, I hit no major roadblocks and that is a new experience. On Day 21 I feel like I am about ready to start working with real data and in a User Interface environment. In the next few days, I want to go over all my "to-dos" from Days 1 - ??? and also redo some of the coding from those days. If I keep making progress, today's app may be one of the ones that are redone. I see now that yesterday I really had an "ah-ha" moment when I began defining functions and calling them recursively. Today I defined two functions and nested one inside the other. I am making progress on this, but I know that I have just begun. I still feel like a Python beginner, but I definitely feel 21 days into it!]
