DAY 4: FEBRUARY 17 , 2019 

Today's Progress: Got more comfortable with methods, objects and using 'this'. Also learned about booleans which can either be set to true or false.

Thoughts: I really like this professor and have cleared up some gaps in my knowledge.

DAY 5: FEBRUARY 18 , 2019 

Today's Progress: Learned about the  ! bang property. It basically takes a boolean value and gets its opposite. This is helpful when we want to toggle something in JS. we also went over for loops. i was previously familair with for loops so most of this was review. He cleared up some loops in my knowledge like when to when we use i inside the function it will be the current item we are on in the loop. Kind of confusiong but working through it. 

Thoughts: For loops arfe kind of confusing but working through it.

DAY 6: FEBRUARY 19 , 2019 

Today's Progress: Today we continued with if else statements and combined it with a for loop. The teacher also stated that we usually use === instead of == when writing JS. === is stricter than ==.  

Thoughts: Combining for loops and if else statements is confusing. I also have to remember when i am inside a for loop i have to specify the instance i am on within the loop by using [i].

DAY 7: FEBRUARY 20 , 2019 

Today's Progress: Today we finished the toggle switch. The toggle switch was comprised of an if else stament which included for loops as well to run through each array item. We also learned about JS data types Objects and Primitives. When we compare primitives it's common sense. If it looks the same it will return true if it doesn't it will return false. The same is nto true for objects. They are a bit more complex. When we compare objects they will return fasle unless we are comparing the object to its exact self meaning meaning comparing 2 objects that look the same written out will return false because they are technically not the same object....We also learned that computers view objects as an address and not as a physical representation like we think it does. Meaning, if you refer to a object when declaring it as a variable it will "go" to that object address. It doesn't assign it as a new object to that variable. 

Thoughts: It helps to learn the nitty gritty stuff AKA the "science.
